### Dense Passage Retrieval (DPR) and Sentence Transformer Model Fine-Tuning ðŸ“‘
<hr>
This repository contains code and notebooks for fine-tuning Dense Passage Retrieval (DPR) and Sentence Transformer models using various techniques to support **multilinguality**. DPR plays a crucial role in open domain and close domain question answering pipelines, while Sentence Transformer models are valuable for finding sentence similarity. The notebooks provide a glimpse into the process of fine-tuning these models.
